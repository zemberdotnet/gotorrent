=Tracker=
==Service Based Design==
	- Client will have called torrent() on the file by this point 
	- Torrent returns relevant data from the torrent file to the client
	- Client now calls tracker()

==I/O==
- In: Trackers main method should take in the *torrentFile struct
- Out: Trackers main method should return the parsed tracker Response to the client
